## Significant changes in 0.9.11

* New words from open sources: 7000 new lexemes
* minor fixes
* huge thanks to **Patreons** and **Github Sponsors** for their support

## Significant changes in 0.9.10

* new words from wiktionaries and open name databases: 77,000 new lexemes,
  mostly proper nouns from the two government's open access name databases:
  * all first names and surnames used in Finland from dvv.fi name registry
  * all place names from the GML data by maanmittauslaitos
  * get details from [statistics 
    page](https://flammie.github.io/omorfi/statistics.html)
* minor fixes to tags and formats, disambiguation and words:
    * apertium format has more subcategories
    * more words from wiktionaries have better paradigms (mainly consonant-final
      nouns)
    * few minor tweaks to prevent odd plurals and singulars for personal
      pronouns that do not have them in normal ue
* test results show same compatibility as always, except:
    * FTB-3.1 is down to 88 % from 90 % and
    * UD vs. Finnish DTD is down to 92 % from 94 %
* python stuff should only use hfst package and not (legacy?) libhfst
    * newest hfst-python should again be installable from pip and other
      packaging sources
* big thanks to **Patreons** and **Github Sponsors** for contiinued support

## Significant changes in 0.9.9

* slight updates to convenience bash scripts
  * bash scripts default to large coverage analyser now, use -Z for old 
   behaviour
* Unimorph 4 compatible
* added the name database from Finnish governments open data repository:
  approx. 20,000 new names and 20,000 existing names verified
* Changed to semver and not so bi-yearly schedule, and to main branch instead
  of outdated git flow model
* nearly 10,000 words moved from main lexicon to MWE; added MWE fragments that
  were previously not in main lexicon (e.g. "Records", "Air", "Las", "Agia",
  "Group", "Air", ...)
* few thousands of words from fiwkikt, enwikt and joukahainen including new
  paradigms for cool and chic (i.e. loan consonant final adjectives), galanga
  root, cisgender, genetic scissors, gay drumming, hybrid influencing,
  spike protein and a lot of birds, mice and compounds
* preliminary support for conda
* homonyms dropped cross part-of-speech, only lemmas within same pos get 
  homonym code and analysis now
* Removed multi-words from main lexicon, if a lexeme has space in it all parts
  are analysed separately
* canonic sort order for TSV files based on python sort (since bash sort is
  not portable across OSes or stable)
* minor fixes for c++ demo and api
* updated words from wiktionaries, joukahainen...
* basic NER parser (~90 % of finer covered)
* improvements in documentation based on feedback
* big thanks to **Patreons** and **GitHub sponsors** for continued support

## Significant changes in 20200511

* Universal dependencies version 2.6 compatible
* 3021 new words, some related to 2020
* preliminary support for pip / pypi / venv
* new logo
* next version will be in semantic versioning scheme, and few breaks in API 
  are to be expected

## Significant changes in 20191111

* Universal dependencies version 2.5 is a reference for recall tests
* 11,343 new words
* Fixed ordinals as adjectives
* Minor overhaul of documentation
* Fixed injection vuln. in python OOV handling

* No other big changes and no API changes

## Significant changes in 20181111

* Universal dependencies version 2.3 is a reference for recall tests
* At least 18,380 new words: 340,931 insertions(+), 322,551 deletions(-)
  * Imported enwikt data on top of re-importing fiwikt, joukahainen
* New CG based on UD tags
* Some universal dependencies guessed (analysers using dep guessing are slower
  and process sentences instead of words)
* Default processing mode for many analysers is now sentence-based
* Slightly extended python API (somewhat modeled like SpaCy but not quite)
* Ability to download compiled FST models from release instead of 
  self-compiling (beta)
* Unimorph used as new Recall / Precision reference gold test set
* Probably some fixes to recasing
* Gradle support for java stuff
* renamed origin unihu → finer

## Significant changes in 20180511

* Universal dependencies version 2.2 is now used as target
* At least 226 new words: 239 additions and 13 deletions in lexeme database
* Most changes are in development infra, so not visible to end users...
* Started rewriting CG from the scratch
* The APIs for programming language deprecate load(filename) and load(dir) forms
  of filename guessing functions in favour of forthcoming loadAnalyser(file),
  loadLemmatiser(file), loadUDPipe(file) etc. etc. functions
* Working towards more general tokenise-analyse-disambiguate pipelines maybe,
  or just refactoring
* lots more automated tests -> lots less human errors
* By popular request: there are two analysers now, one with small dictionary
  and one with full, use the smaller one when you do not want to see birds or
  languages or tribes analysed. The smaller one replaces the old default, but
  the new tools will require you to select one explicitly anyways
* fixes and workarounds: java and c++ can now be disabled partially or totally
* adopted SG0 as possible verb form analysis from UD data
* The end users are now provided with bash-scripts wrappers for all
  functionalities, whereas the typically python versions allow more control
  of parametres


## Significant changes in 20170515

* Universal Dependencies version 2 is now used, still mainly lemma, UPOS,
  features fields are analysed
* At least 2,336 new words (based on diffstat: 38886 additions, 3655 deletions)
* Preliminary support for various guessing models: python-based, finite-state
  and UDPipe. This means that it is possibly to get analyses for all tokens,
  albeit quality of guesses varies.
* A minimal C++ library version has been made to match java and python bindings.
  C++-11 and libhfst are required.
* The dix version can now be compiled with lttoolbox with a lot of memory
* A restricted "gold" dictionary mode has been added. This is good for both end
  users with limited memory and end users who require higher quality lexemes
  (i.e., only research institute approved, no wiktionary words or other weird
   stuffs)
* Documentations and automatic testing much reworked with the new modern toys
  from github: travis-ci, jekyll
* Started weeding the ADP/ADV jungle...
* Fixed a horrible bug in the corpus coverage testing that terribly
  under-estimated our coverage for corpora where hapax legomena etc. were
  ignored
* Lot of documentation has been semi-automated, therefore many changes can be
  viewed at the new gh-pages site: https://flammie.github.io/omorfi/

## Significant changes in 20161115

* Started drafting more blacklists and *known good* lexemes subsets for people
  who struggle with rare words and productive compounding, derivation
* Updated to Universal Dependencies version 1.4
* A lot of new derivations by the way
* Preliminary guessers
* More loopy guessery things for punctuation and digit combos
* Minor fixes to UD feature sorting
* Homonym numbers used in some applications
* Added timeouts where downstream tools support them, so tools don't seem like
  they are freezing at random
* moved old documentations to github-pages
* added preliminary hfst-pmatch-based tokeniser

## Significant changes in 20160515

* Universal Dependencies for Finnish is the new standard format we now follow:
    * POS is now UPOS and classes were changed accordingly (new classes: AUX,
      PROPN, DET, CONJ, SCONJ, PUNCT, SYM, and VERB, NOUN, ADP, ADV as before)
    * other features mostly match the feature field in UD documentation
    * release cycle aims to be same six month cycle as with UD
    * the automatic tests verify compatibility with UD; 92 % of lemmas, primary
      POS tags and morphological features are the same as Finnish UD corpus,
      75 % same as Finnish FTB UD corpus
    * analyser for reading and writing CONLL-U format
* tokenisation as script and more hacks to token stripping in corner cases
* continuous integration with travis-ci, currently only testing basic script
  programming conventions
* added a lot of high coverage words and forms by hand
* by popular request, some of the words can now be blacklisted, when you don't
  want that guy named Mutta to ambiguate your conjunction analyses or the odd
  new guinean bird to clash with some common verb
* the "database" is now only keyed on lemma + homonym number; paradigm is extra
  information like anything else
* a lot of work on morphological segmentation towards statistical machine
  translation; check proceedings of WMT shared tasks 2015 and 2016 to see why
* started refactoring some python code into classes

## Significant changes in 20150904

* allomorphy can be tagged again to distinguish e.g. *-iden* and *-itten* when
  generating
* FinnTreeBank-1 format provided by Miikka Silfverberg is available but not
  built by default since it lacks a test set

  inessive distinguished from regular inessive
* preliminary VISL CG-3 support, with original grammar by Fred Karlsson;
  convenience bash scripts available for disambiguated parsing
* preliminary support for conllu and conllx analysis formats
* paradigm categorisation is now verified by regular expressions
* lots of paradigm fixes and some added words
