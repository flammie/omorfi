====================================================
 Omorfi–Open source Morphology for Finnish language
====================================================

This package contains free and open source implementation of morphological
analysis for Finnish language. It uses GPL licenced HFST tools as
implementation of morphological description. This package is licenced under GNU
GPL version 3, but not necessarily later. Licence can be found from ``COPYING``
file in root of the distribution package. Other licences are possible from
authors named in the ``AUTHORS``.

The dictionaries used in omorfi are `Nykysuomen sanalista
<http://kaino.kotus.fi>`_ (LGPL),  `Joukahainen
<http://joukahainen.lokalisointi.org>`_ (GPL) and `Finnwordnet
<http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/research/finnwordnet>`_ (Princeton Wordnet licence
/ GPL; relicenced with kind permission from University of Helsinki). Some words
have also been collected by omorfi developers and contributors.

Downloading
-----------

`Omorfi can be found from gna! service <http://gna.org/projects/omorfi>`_.
`Omorfi download directory <http://download.gna.org/omorfi/>`_ contains
release packages. Development version can be found from gna! SVN server.
In Gentoo_ distribution omorfi can be installed from `science overlay`_.

Dependencies
------------

Compilation of automata requires HFST tools or compatible installed:

* hfst-3.0.2 or greater is required for omorfi version 20110505

The rebuilding of lexical data is not usually necessary unless you want to
update the base resources. For lexical data handling, additional tools are
needed:

- ``python`` is needed to rebuild lexc lexicons from CSV data

- XSLT processor supporting XSLT 2.0 is needed to extract CSV data from
  XML-based lexical sources:

  - ``java`` must be able to access ``net.sf.saxon.Transform`` in existing
    env., or
  
  - script named ``saxon``, ``saxon8``, ``saxon9``, or ``saxonb-xslt`` must
    execute it

The final transducers can be used with HFST tools, HFST runtime tools, SFST
tools or OpenFST tools (the last two are untested but should work). The
automata can also be used by other software projects, such as Voikko
spell checking library and apertium machine translation system.

Installation
------------

Installation uses standard autotools system::

  ./configure && make && make install

The compiling may take forever or more depending on the hardware you are using.
The stable versions should be compilable on average end-user laptops, such as
my Acer Aspire one.

If configure cannot find HFST tools, you must tell it where to find them::

  ./configure --with-hfst=${HFSTPATH}

Autotools system supports installation to e.g. home directory::

  ./configure --prefix=${HOME}

In CVS or SVN version you must create necessary autotools files in host system::

  ./autogen.sh

For further instructions, see ``INSTALL``, the GNU standard install instructions
for autotools systems.

Usage
-----

Omorfi installs experimental scripts that are meant for easy command line
based use of omorfi automata: ``omorfi-analyse.sh`` is a simple shell script
invoking ``hfst-proc`` tokenising analyser, which uses the morphological
analyser to break the input into words and then analyses them. The basic
usage::

  omorfi-analyse.sh [TAGSET [FILENAME]]

So for basic analysis of a text file named ``kalevala.txt`` is::

  omorfi-analyse.sh cg kalevala.txt

or::

  omorfi-analyse.sh cg < kalevala.txt

To see other tagging formats, replace ``cg`` with ``omor``, ``apertium``,
``ftc``, ``finntreebank`` etc. Use --help to get full listing of installed
tagsets. 

The script ``omorfi-interactive.sh`` can be used to analyse pre-tokenised text
or input one word form at a time from the shell (N.B. the input is read raw
from command line, so special keys, such as arrows will not work).

The other functions of omorfi are also accesible through scripts:
``omorfi-spell.sh`` performs spell-checking using the dictionary,
``omorfi-suggest.sh`` performs spelling correction, ``omorfi-hyphenate.sh`` can
hyphenate isolated word forms and ``omorfi-generate.sh`` may be used to turn
analysis strings into word forms.  These scripts are experimental and may not
work in current version.

For more advanced usage, you may see ``${prefix}/share/hfst/fi/`` directory,
which contains all the omorfi automata. These can be manipulated by standard
HFST tools.

On character codings
--------------------

The implementation of morphology uses UTF-8 encoded Unicode, and all relevant
tools typically only process UTF-8 encoded format. This may cause
some problems. Firstly there are some characters which have less ambiguous
Unicode variants than their ASCII versions, namely the U+2019 RIGHT SINGLE
QUOTATION MARK and U+2010 HYPHEN. The analysis should work with both them and
the legacy 0x27 APOSTROPHE and 0x2D HYPHEN-MINUS, but this variation may cause
problems. 

On some systems characters with potential diacritics, such as ä and ö,
may be encoded differently; the implemented version uses the form of unicode
where diacritics are precomposed to characters, also known as unicode
normal form C (NFC). Systems using decomposed form (NFD) may experience
problems.

Programming and project management
----------------------------------

Omorfi rulesets and codes are free and libre open source, modifiable and
redistributable by anyone. For participation in project it is recommended to
follow rules common in majority of free and open source projects, such as
`GNU project style guide <http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html>`_,
and `autobook book <http://sources.redhat.com/autobook/>`_ (esp. § 9.1.1)
and instructions in project’s HACKING_ file. Bugs should be reported through
`omorfi’s gna! bug tracker <http://gna.org/bugs/?group=omorfi>`_ system.
