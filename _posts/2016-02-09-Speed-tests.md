# Introduction

While omorfi does not directly produce any finite-state automata etc. software,
it is possible that changes in lexicon and serialisation affect the running
time of the automata. This page contains automated tests per release for omorfi
to give you an idea of how fast the components might be.

# Automated tests


These are in ascending order of time, since I just `>>` them to the end of this
file. For sheet view, see [omorfi progress sheet in google
 docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eTpUhCz0SzpRl3VYjuzI7etFB2N2bPrzyTV43ebYf6k/edit?usp=sharing)
