# Omorfi and licences

Omorfi is developed primarily under GNU GPLv3 licence. This means that author's
intention of the lexical database and the scripts is to be strong copyleft. The
author's intent is that anyone who makes use of omorfi and improves it will
release their improvements publically and freely with the same licence.

*While law is currently unclear / lacking, it is my opinion that using omorfi in
tivoized, saas, container, web service, baked into llm, etc. to circumvent
copyleft licence is not acceptable.*

## Copyright holders

The authors of omorfi are listed in AUTHORS file and are authors in the terms of
copyright and when authorship should be published to fulfill terms of licence.
In the unlikely event of changing licences in the future, it should be approved
by all authors in the AUTHORS file.

## Other sources used

The lexical database in omorfi collects information from various free and open
sources. Most of the sources are CC-BY or such licence that has less or same
restrictions than omorfi licence, and their derivations are thus compatible with
stricter licencing:
